This is a plugin system that I developped at Oblique fx (www.obliquefx.com) 
to handle the ActionMenu items in Shotgun on Windows. 

You need this file in your python path. Name it shotgun_action.py.

You must first register the OBQ protocol on windows. 
To do this, edit the file Register_OBQ_protocol.reg and set the right path to the obqProtocolHandler.py
and then double-click on it to register it.
